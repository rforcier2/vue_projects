### How do I *vue* these on my computer? 
- Just download and open the index.html files on your browser!
- if you would rather host them locally, you can do so using NodeJS and my preferred test server: http-server

 - I used [NodeJS][1] and [http-server][2] to host the page locally.
 - Download [NodeJS][1] for your OS
 - To check Node was installed on your OS go ahead and open either Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and type `node -v` and hit enter. Your computer should prompt you with the Version number that is currently installed on your OS.
 - This installation also comes with [npm][3] or Node Package Manager.
 - To verify npm has been installed open your terminal (if already closed) and type `npm -v`. This will return the current version of npm installed on your computer.
- To use http-server to host this content locally, use npm!
- Open your terminal and type `npm install http-server -g`
- navigate to the project of your choice and type `http-server` and hit return.
- this should start a localhost on port 8080 (it will output instructions in the terminal)
- Now navigate to localhost:8080/index.html and voila! you will see the "live" rendered site.
- I also, encourage you to make changes and see how it affects the webpage. Good luck!
